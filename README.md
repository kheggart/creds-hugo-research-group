Refer to https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/ for more things.

> blockquotes like this

cta buttons like this:
{{< cta cta_text="Visit the Teacher Professional Learning Networks site" cta_link="https://sites.google.com/site/educatorplns/" cta_new_tab="true" >}}


## Cross ref things
You can refer to other pages like this, views are 4 is an APA citation, 3 is a card, 1 and 2 are listy
YOU MUST NOT INCLUDE TRAILING SLASH IN ANY LINKS

{{< cite page="/publication/preprint" view="4" >}}


## Make spoilers
To create a spoiler (expandable) use

{{< spoiler text="Click to read more" >}}
and close
{{< /spoiler >}}

## Embed some stuff 

{{< youtube WXxp3saPeXQ >}}
{{< vimeo 146022717 >}}

{{< tweet 666616452582129664 >}}

{{< gdocs src="https://docs.google.com/..." >}} (but needs to be published)

### For embedding images (not just in the header)

There's a markdown way, and there's an inelegant (but, let's you do useful things) way, e.g of the latter:
<div style= "float:right;margin:5px;width:50%;">{{< figure src="analytics.jpg" caption="Modeling change, Photo by <a href='https://unsplash.com/@edhoradic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText'>Edho Pratama</a> on <a href='https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText'>Unsplash</a>" numbered="false" alt="Search result image for 'analytics', by Edho Pratama on Unsplash" >}}</div>

### To insert tables

Check out one of the markdown table generators, or use the gui rstudio approach

## If you have a HTML page (e.g. from the conversation) you want to embed
1. create an index.md page as usual, with yaml header per above
2. in the index.md content use {{< include-md "body.md" >}}
3. in body.md put an empty header ( ---  and close --- ), and whatever's between <body> tags in html


## To make links
[I'm an external link](https://www.google.com)
[A post]({{< relref "/post/my-page-name" >}})
[A publication]({{< relref "/publication/my-page-name" >}})
[A project]({{< relref "/project/my-page-name" >}})
[A relative link from one post to another post]({{< relref "../my-page-name" >}})
[Scroll down to a page section with heading *Hi*](#hi)

### and for a file you might put it in /static/uploads/
{{% staticref "uploads/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}




## References
Used another great tool, wowchemy publication tool to create publication pages from bibtex; may need periodic updating (or connecting to a feed) https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-academic-cli 

I obtained the bibtex from publish or perish (via google scholar), and did some minor editing in Zotero before exporting. BUT this is flawed, scholar only lets you grab the first x authors, so many pubs have ... as an author...these need fixing at some point

## Link gardens and back links
I'm interested in drawing on ideas of digital gardens or link gardens, in which rather than organising by date, people navigate through starting at different points and going down different paths through connected content.  Tags and categories can do that to some degree, but it tends to always be sequential. An obvious use case in academia is wanting to show links between people <-> projects <-> publications <-> news <-> methods, etc. 

To do this I made some edits from (note, if the directory structure is as mine/wowchemy and uses index.md within a named directory per-post, you need to change BaseFileName to ContentBaseName in the backlinks partial)

Other places that have implemented some form of backlink approach in hugo are:
* https://github.com/kausalflow/connectome/tree/master/layouts/partials (see also https://hugo-connectome.kausalflow.com/graph/ )
*  https://gabrielleearnshaw.medium.com/implementing-backlinks-in-a-hugo-website-e548d3d8f0e0 
* and https://seds.nl/notes/export_org_roam_backlinks_with_gohugo/ (despite the url it isn't roam export, it's within hugo)
* @apreshill also has an "on this page" which shows the headings for a page, which I assume could be used to show the links https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/search?q=%22on+this+page%22&type=
