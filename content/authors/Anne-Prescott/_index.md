From 2011 Anne conducted mathematics, science and English teacher professional development in a remote region of Nepal. This work was extended to include rebuilding schools, toilets and the Bhawani School hostel. In 2014 Anne was awarded the UTS Human Rights Award for Social Inclusion for her work in making it possible for Nepali girls to continue their education in secondary school.
