Dr Marco Angelini is currently the Outreach Program and Research Coordinator at UTS Women in Engineering and IT. This project uses a design thinking pedagogy to engage primary and secondary school students in STEM projects that are conducted in-curriculum. WiEIT’s research uses bipolar scaling methods, focus group and open question surveys to gather data from participants.

He was Project Manager for the recently completed Maths Inside project, a multi-agency research venture funded by the Australian Commonwealth and based at UTS; this work led to the publication of "Making School Maths Engaging", published by Springer in 2020.

His professional background is in academic skills development, educational equity and the transition to higher education; he has taught in humanities and science subjects at London School of Economics, Queen’s University of Belfast and University of Technology Sydney. While at University College London he set up and managed student engagement and equity projects including the Transition Programme. At UCL he was Director of the UK National Transition Conference from 2007-2012. His research interests and publications include work on student engagement, academic literacies, philosophical thought and history.
