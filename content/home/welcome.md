We explore the dynamic relationship between technology and learning â€“ across formal, informal, and professional education contexts throughout the lifespan.

Our research interrogates the new ways in which technologies enhance learning, and the changing learning needs of a digital society.

We aim to address the broad question of how we understand the dynamic relationship between technology, society, and learning.
