â€¢	Collaboration analytics Inventing the Next Generation Nursing Simulation Ward  Human-centred Teamwork Analytics is an ARC funded Discovery Project (DP210100060). This project aims to develop methods to assist the assessment and improvement of collocated teamwork, by making multimodal activity traces visible and available for computational analysis. This project expects to bridge the gap between promising sensing technologies and the dearth of tools to automatically assess teamwork. Expected outcomes include co-design and modelling methodologies for human-centred analytics that map from low-level data to higher-order constructs to enable non-data science savvy users to get actionable insights into multimodal team traces. This research aims to provide significant benefits to Australia, with communication and teamwork being two of the topmost critical skills required by Australian employers. At UTS this project is led by Professor Simon Buckingham Shum, with colleagues at Monash University.
