Our cutting-edge research in education leads the way in productive and ethical use of data and technology in classrooms. Drawing from the fields of learning analytics, educational data mining, and artificial intelligence in education, the core focus of the research strand is in the integration and implementation of technology to improve teaching and learning practices. We augment pedagogical practices with technological innovations by cross-fertilizing research and practice. Most commonly, the work involves co-design with key stakeholders such as educators and students to build and evaluate relevant educational tools for classrooms. Research in the strand employs mixed methods including quantitative, qualitative and analytic approaches. An example is the development of an automated writing feedback tool called ‘AcaWriter’ with a multi-disciplinary team of faculty members in UTS from Learning Analytics, Law, Accounting and Pharmacy – here, the tool’s automated feedback and pedagogic interventions were co-designed with the educators tying it to authentic assessments in their specific disciplinary writing contexts in higher education.
