A new strategic project, TRACK, is using data, analytics and Artificial Intelligence to help students make good decisions to land their dream job. It’s also helping UTS design curriculum that anticipates the skills required in the workplace of the future. 

Some UTS students know what they want to be, but don’t know what they need to study to get there. Others know what they’re interested in or good at, but can’t quite work out how to link subject choices to potential career outcomes.

How can we use data, analytics and Artificial Intelligence to help our students make sound decisions about which subjects to take and land their dream job in an increasingly uncertain job market?
