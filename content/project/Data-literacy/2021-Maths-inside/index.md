The Maths Inside project offers a series of eight maths lessons that are based on real research projects that are undertaken by CSIRO researchers and mathematicians. They offer insights as to how maths is used to solve research problems.

> A UTS cross faculty team from Science and Arts and Social Sciences was awarded $1.9m in funding, over three years, to research and develop learning resources aimed at increasing high school student engagement in mathematics. 

Explore the Maths Inside resources to find materials for teacher professional learning, alongside practical classroom resources and examples for use in school.
