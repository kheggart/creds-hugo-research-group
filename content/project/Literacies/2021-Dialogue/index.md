Learning is a fundamentally social process. We know that certain kinds of dialogue support learning. Technologies have the potential to foster this dialogue, helping people to make their reasoning explicit, engage with each other, and engage in dialogic (or many voiced) learning. Of course, technology also has the potential to foster marginalisation and division. In this strand of our research, we investigate the role of dialogue and technology in learning, and how we can create constructive learning environments. Our work has been in schools but has application for any professional learning context, and for technology developers. We use design approaches, and discourse analysis, to investigate and evaluate design for learning.
