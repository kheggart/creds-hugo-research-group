In the CiteLearn project, funded by Wikicred, we are developing a  tool to support people in learning a key skill of verifiability, to support the writing and flow of credible information. The tool makes use of natural language processing to analyse texts and provide feedback on where citations should (or should not) be within sentences. This serves both to support onboard of editors to develop high quality content on Wikipedia, and other kinds of learners including students who must cite sources to ground their claims in evidence. 

Our research has investigated both the design of a tool to support learning how to cite, and the ways in which practices of citation on Wikipedia and in academia are bound up with communities and tools, and the implications of this for how data from features such as \{\{citation needed\}\} may be used.
