Searching to learn (Bhuva + Simon) My research suggests that in a digital society with information overload, the problem is not information access, but information avoidance, and selective information seeking. People with authoritative information are not always engaging with their intended audience in a meaningful way. Information design that is not scaffolded to adult learning is also an issue. Engagement is the fulcrum of societal impact, and those that know how to engage their intended audience are the ones that have the impact; sadly, these are not always researchers or scientists. There is more research needed on human learning and human psychology in the digital society to understand these issues in order to design and implement technologies. We also need to work closely with technology designers to help them understand how to design for such learning.
