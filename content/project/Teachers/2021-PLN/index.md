Projects in this space have investigated teacher professional development and professional learning networks (PLNs) and the role of technology in supporting these.

In the video-case below, UTS pre-service teachers discuss their use of self-initiated online PLNs (top RHS of Table above) to support their development as teachers. Given these activities are mostly mediated by use of their mobile devices, the activities are then examined through the lens of the iPAC Framework.
