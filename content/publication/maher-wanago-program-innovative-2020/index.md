abstract: "According to the report titled 'A Smart Move: Future-proofing Australia's workforce', it was estimated that in the next decade, 75 percent of all jobs will need science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills (PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia, 2015). However, only 16 percent of university students are currently pursuing degrees in these disciplines. Of this 16 percent, young women are very under-represented with reports showing that males make up 84 percent of the total number of people with STEM qualifications (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2016) and only 13 percent of all engineers in Australia were women (Stewart, 2017)."
