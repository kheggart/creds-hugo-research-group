> Centre members investigate learning technologies, and the role of technology and data in learning, developing methods to evaluate this impact.

We view the relationship between technology and learning as dynamic, reflecting that how we learn (with technology) is fundamentally intertwined with what we learn (about technology). In the research strands below, there are 4 key themes, that  address this dynamic interaction. Click the links below to read more, and view the projects related to the theme.

1. [Understanding digital learning in a digital society](#Change): This strand of work is about our approaches to understanding learning needs and addressing these through technologies.
1. [Digital learning for digital literacies](#Literacies): The ways technology introduces new challenges and needs in digital literacy from tackling misinformation to understanding how algorithms shape our social media; and that technologies may be used to support these literacies
1. [Our datafied world and tools to understand it](#Data): That there is an impetus for us to learn new technologies and approaches to data that help us understand our world for a sustainable future,  and that there are new tools to support us in this, including simulations and extended reality to develop our data literacy
1. [The digital teacher](#Teacher): That teachers play a central role in learning in society, and that their own learning needs have been impacted by digital tools, but that digital tools also offer opportunities to support teacher learning
