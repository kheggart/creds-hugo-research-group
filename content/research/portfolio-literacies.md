## Digital learning for digital literacies [{{< icon name="link" pack="fas" >}}](.#Literacies) [{{< icon name="level-up-alt" pack="fas" >}}](.) {#Literacies} 

This strand of work is about the ways that technology introduces new challenges and needs in digital literacy from tackling misinformation to understanding how algorithms shape our social media; and that technologies may be used to support these literacies

### New literacies for a digital society

A body of work focuses on the impacts of technology on literacy, from the role of technology in civic life such as the impact of facebook on elections, to how we understand technologies to share and build our knowledge together through platforms like Wikipedia.

### The role of technology in critical and creative thinking

Research in this area investigates the ways particular sets of technologies – from social media, to search engines, and specific learning technologies – impact the ways we think, particularly focusing on learners’ critical and creative thinking, across formal, informal, and workplace learning contexts.
