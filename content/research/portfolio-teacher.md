### Teacher professional development for technology and data

A body of Centre research investigates the evolution of teacher professional development needs, and approaches to addressing this. In this area, we have conducted research focusing on innovative technology-mediated learning in K-12 and teacher education contexts, particularly the specific pedagogical features or affordances of mobile devices to support learning. Other centre members have investigated a framework to understand key enablers for technology integration, grounded in exemplary teachers’ knowledge of technology integration in K-12 classrooms.

### Technology for teacher professional learning across disciplines

A strand of Centre research investigates teacher professional development using technologies to support their learning. This work analyses professional’s design practices, and the ways in which technologies support design for learning, the specific affordances of learning technologies such as mobile devices and social media platforms for professional learning and developing personal professional learning networks.
