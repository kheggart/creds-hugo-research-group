# Digital learning for digital literacies

This strand of work is about the ways that technology introduces new challenges and needs in digital literacy from tackling misinformation to understanding how algorithms shape our social media; and that technologies may be used to support these literacies

{{< spoiler text="Click to read more" >}}

## New literacies for a digital society

A body of work focuses on the impacts of technology on literacy, from the role of technology in civic life such as the impact of facebook on elections, to how we understand technologies to share and build our knowledge together through platforms like Wikipedia.

## The role of technology in critical and creative thinking

Research in this area investigates the ways particular sets of technologies – from social media, to search engines, and specific learning technologies – impact the ways we think, particularly focusing on learners’ critical and creative thinking, across formal, informal, and workplace learning contexts.

# Our datafied world and tools to understand it

That there is an impetus for us to learn new technologies and approaches to data that help us understand our world for a sustainable future,  and that there are new tools to support us in this, including simulations and extended reality to develop our data literacy

## The role of data literacy, numeracy, and maths subjects

A strand of our research focuses on the data, numeracy, and mathematics skills required in the 21st century in the workplace, civic participation, and day-to-day life, particularly focusing on the numeracy needs of educators.

## Technology integrated learning across STEM and beyond

Research in this space has explored both the ways that technologies from particular disciplines – such as engineering tools – and other technologies drawing on mobile, immersive, and wider digital technologies, can support experiential learning across discipline areas.

# The digital teacher

Research in this strand recognises that teachers play a central role in learning in society, and that their own learning needs have been impacted by digital tools, but that digital tools also offer opportunities to support teacher learning.

## Teacher professional development for technology and data

A body of Centre research investigates the evolution of teacher professional development needs, and approaches to addressing this. In this area, we have conducted research focusing on innovative technology-mediated learning in K-12 and teacher education contexts, particularly the specific pedagogical features or affordances of mobile devices to support learning. Other centre members have investigated a framework to understand key enablers for technology integration, grounded in exemplary teachers’ knowledge of technology integration in K-12 classrooms.

## Technology for teacher professional learning across disciplines

A strand of Centre research investigates teacher professional development using technologies to support their learning. This work analyses professional’s design practices, and the ways in which technologies support design for learning, the specific affordances of learning technologies such as mobile devices and social media platforms for professional learning and developing personal professional learning networks.
