> Centre members investigate learning technologies, and the role of technology and data in learning, developing methods to evaluate this impact.

We view the relationship between technology and learning as dynamic, reflecting that how we learn (with technology) is fundamentally intertwined with what we learn (about technology). In the research strands below, there are 4 key themes, that  address this dynamic interaction. Click the links below to read more, and view the projects related to the theme.
